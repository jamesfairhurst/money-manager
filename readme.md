# Money Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamesfairhurst/money-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesfairhurst/money-manager)

I wanted a way to easily manage, track & tag my money so I'm building this little app to do it for me. I've been through a number of iterations but never to completion and I keep over complicating things so **this time** I'm going to follow through!

The very basics are:

- Transactions
    + ~~Index, add, edit & delete~~
    + Import from csv (bank statements)
- Tags
    + Index, add, edit & delete
    + Attach Tags to Transactions and vice versa
- Dashboard
    + Graphs of top tags
    + Week/month/year filters

Possible future extras are:

- Transactions
    + Upload image per transaction (reciepts)
        * Simple file uploads via add/edit form
        * Dropbox integration
- Accounts
    + Have multiple accounts e.g. current, credit, joint etc
- Users
    + have multiple users with registration, login etc
